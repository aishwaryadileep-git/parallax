    <h2><b>SEOUL, REPUBLIC OF KOREA</b></h2>
    <p>Seoul is the capital of South Korea and the economic and cultural center of the Republic of Korea. Situated on the lower Han River the capital is only 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone established with North Korea in 1953. The heart of Seoul is dominated by a city center that dates to the Yi dynasty state, which began in the 14th Century. Although skyscrapers now exist, the central city retains the layout of the royal capital which was designed according to traditional Chinese principles of city panning -- main streets running north-south and east-west. City Hall Plaza is the hub of much of the economic activity in Seoul, with two subway lines converging in this area, and many corporate office buildings, hotels, banks, and department stores.
         Seoul also achieved international recognition when it hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics..</p>
